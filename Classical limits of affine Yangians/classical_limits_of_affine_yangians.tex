\section{Classical limits of affine Yangians}
    \subsection{Coproducts on affine Yangians}
        \todo[inline]{Dat: For type $\sfA_2^{(2)}$, see Mamoru's paper \url{https://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~kyodo/kokyuroku/contents/pdf/2161-17.pdf}. I still don't know if we have a coproduct construction for type $\sfA_1^{(1)}$. Otherwise, the construction \cite{guay_nakajima_wendlandt_affine_yangian_coproduct} works for all types except $\sfA_1^{(1)}$. I misremembered that we do not have a coproduct construction when $\g$ isn't simply laced; what I should have said is that we don't have PBW when $\g$ is not simply laced.}

    \subsection{Classical limits of affine Yangians}
        \todo[inline]{Dat: This depends on the previous section as well as subsection \ref{subsection: affine_yangians_as_flat_deformations_of_toroidal_lie_algebras}, so we can only compute the classical limit when $\g$ is simply laced. Hopefully, we'll also be able to show that the quantum R-matrices descends to the classical r-matrices of the underlying toroidal Lie bialgebras too.}

        \begin{lemma} \label{lemma: toroidal_cobracket_on_current_generators}
            
        \end{lemma}
            \begin{proof}
                
            \end{proof}

    \subsection{Restricted Hopf duals and quantum doubles of affine Yangians, and their classical limits}
        \todo[inline]{Dat: As far as I can tell, we can only compute these when $\g$ is not of type $\sfA_2^{(1)}$.

        In \cite{enriquez_geer_compatibility_of_etingof_kazhdan_quantisation_with_duality_and_doubling}, Enriquez and Geer showed that the Etingof-Kazhdan quantisation functor commutes with taking duals and doubles, so once we have verified that the affine Yangian quantises $\toroidal_A^+$, we can invoke this result. The Manin triple with $\toroidal_A^+$ playing the role of the "positively polarised" part will be of the form:
            $$( \Dr(\toroidal_A^+), \toroidal_A^+, (\toroidal_A^+)^{\star} )$$
        with $(\toroidal_A^+)^{\star} \cong \g \tensor t^{-1}\bbC[v^{\pm 1}, t^{-1}] \rtimes \d_A^+$ being the graded dual taken inside $\extendedtoroidal_A$, and $\Dr(\toroidal_A^+)$ denoting the classical Drinfeld double. What we will then need to show is that the affine double Yangian in the literature (see e.g. \cite{wendlandt_formal_shift_operators_on_yangian_doubles} or \cite{guay_regelskis_wendlandt_affine_yangian_vertex_representations_and_PBW}) is a quantisation of $\Dr(\toroidal_A^+)$ and a quantum Drinfeld double/Hopf double of the affine Yangian.}
