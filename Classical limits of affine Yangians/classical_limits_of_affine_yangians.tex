\section{Classical limits of affine (double) Yangians}
    \subsection{Coproducts on affine (double) Yangians}
        \todo[inline]{Dat: For type $\sfA_2^{(2)}$, see Mamoru's paper \url{https://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~kyodo/kokyuroku/contents/pdf/2161-17.pdf}. I still don't know if we have a coproduct construction for type $\sfA_1^{(1)}$. Otherwise, the construction \cite{guay_nakajima_wendlandt_affine_yangian_coproduct} works for all types except $\sfA_1^{(1)}$. I misremembered that we do not have a coproduct construction when $\hat{\g}$ isn't simply laced; what I should have said is that we don't have PBW when $\hat{\g}$ is not simply laced.}

    \subsection{Restricted Hopf duals and quantum doubles of affine Yangians}
        \todo[inline]{Dat: As far as I can tell, we can only compute these when $\hat{\g}$ is not of type $\sfA_2^{(1)}$.}

    \subsection{Classical limits}
        \todo[inline]{Dat: This depends on the previous section as well as subsection \ref{subsection: affine_(double)_yangians_as_flat_deformations_of_toroidal_lie_algebras}, so we can only compute the classical limit when $\hat{\g}$ is simply laced. Hopefully, we'll also be able to show that the quantum R-matrices descends to the classical r-matrices of the underlying toroidal Lie bialgebras too.}
