\section{Quantum toroidal algebras and their classical limits}
    \subsection{Quantum toroidal algebras}
        \todo[inline]{Recall the construction of quantum toroidal algebras and coproducts thereon from \cite{laurie_toroidal_QUEs_coproducts_2}.}

    \subsection{Classical limits}
        \todo[inline]{Dat: Check if the degree-$(0, 0)$ toroidal Lie cobracket from subsection \ref{subsection: toroidal_lie_bialgebras} is the classical limit of the coproduct from \cite{laurie_toroidal_QUEs_coproducts_2}. PBW is known from \cite{enriquez_PBW_and_duality_theorems_for_toroidal_QUEs}.}
