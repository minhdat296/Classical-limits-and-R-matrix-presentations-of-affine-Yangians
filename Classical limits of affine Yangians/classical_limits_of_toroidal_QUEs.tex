\section{Quantum toroidal algebras and their classical limits}
    \subsection{Quantum toroidal algebras}
        \todo[inline]{Recall the construction of quantum toroidal algebras and coproducts thereon from \cite{laurie_toroidal_QUEs_coproducts_2}.}

    \subsection{Classical limits}
        \todo[inline]{Dat: Check if the degree-$(0, 0)$ toroidal Lie cobracket from subsection \ref{subsection: toroidal_lie_bialgebras} is the classical limit of the coproduct from \cite{laurie_toroidal_QUEs_coproducts_1}. I don't think we have PBW for quantum toroidal algebras outside of type $\sfA$, so even if the coproduct descends to the correct cobracket, this will \textit{not} be enough to confirm in general that the quantum toroidal algebras from \cite{laurie_toroidal_QUEs_coproducts_2} are quantisations of the toroidal Lie bialgeras above. In type $\sfA$, though, see \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06277} and \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01314}.}
