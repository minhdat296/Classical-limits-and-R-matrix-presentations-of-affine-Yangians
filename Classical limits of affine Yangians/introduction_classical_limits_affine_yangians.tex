            Throughout, we fix a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra $\bar{\g}$ over $\bbC$, though in principle, we can work over any algebraically closed field characteristic $0$. On this Lie algebra, we choose once and for all a symmetric, non-degenerate, and invariant bilinear form $(\cdot, \cdot)_{\bar{\g}}$; \textit{a priori}, any such bilinear form is a non-zero scalar multiple of the Killing form. Let us fix also a Cartan subalgebra $\bar{\h} \subset \bar{\g}$ of dimension $l$. By means of the bilinear form fixed above, we can define a root system $\bar{\rootsystem} \subset \bar{\h}^*$, in which we choose a subset of simple roots indexed by a set $\bar{\simpleroots}$ of cardinality $l$. With respect to these choices, we have a set of Chevalley-Serre generators $\{h_i, e_i^{\pm}\}_{i \in \bar{\simpleroots}}$, normalised so that $(h_i, h_j)_{\bar{\g}} = \1_{i, j}$, wherein $\1_{i, j}$ is the Kronecker delta.
