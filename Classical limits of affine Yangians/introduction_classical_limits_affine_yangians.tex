\section{Introduction}
    \subsection{Notations}
        Throughout, we fix a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra $\g$ over $\bbC$, though in principle, we can work over any algebraically closed field characteristic $0$. On this Lie algebra, we choose once and for all a symmetric, non-degenerate, and invariant bilinear form $(\cdot, \cdot)_{\g}$; \textit{a priori}, any such bilinear form is a non-zero scalar multiple of the Killing form. Let us fix also a Cartan subalgebra $\h \subset \g$ of dimension $l$. By means of the bilinear form fixed above, we can define a root system $\rootsystem \subset \h^*$, in which we choose a subset of simple roots indexed by a set $\simpleroots$ of cardinality $l$. With respect to these choices, we have a set of Chevalley-Serre generators $\{h_i, x_i^{\pm}\}_{i \in \simpleroots}$, normalised so that $(h_i, h_j)_{\g} = \delta_{i, j}$.
